          note: To be able to fix this CVE, we need to upgrade the "org.apache.cassandra:cassandra-all" dependency version from `2.2.12` which is the version project is currently using to at least `4.0.10` which is the version we should bump to to fix the CVEs but we can't because the build was failed due to compilation errors.

There is an also an open PR about the CVE in the 'snakeyaml': https://github.com/thelastpickle/cassandra-reaper/pull/1455"
