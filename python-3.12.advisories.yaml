    - timestamp: 2023-03-11T17:20:54.584305-05:00
      status: not_affected

    - timestamp: 2023-06-28T08:12:51.372694-04:00
      status: affected
      action: |
        Users should upgrade to version 3.12.0_beta1-r0 or later and set the filter parameter to 'data' when calling TarFile.extract and TarFile.extractall methods. For more information, see https://peps.python.org/pep-0706/.
    - timestamp: 2023-07-11T14:09:29.265761-04:00
      status: not_affected
      justification: vulnerable_code_not_present
      impact: Upon further investigation, we have determined that this is not a security issue in the Python package itself. It's still possible to misuse the Python standard library, such as by supplying untrusted data to the tar extraction functions, in which case a vulnerability should be identified in the caller code.
